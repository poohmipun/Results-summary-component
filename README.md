## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

"Embarking on my Frontend Journey! ðŸš€ Learning HTML and CSS with Frontend Mentor Challenges! ðŸ’»ðŸ“š"

After about 4 hours of doing the wrong thing and asking ChatGPT for help, I finally finished the project. ðŸ˜… This project really made me realize that "this is 100% not the right way to do it." ðŸ˜© I'm exhausted, and I believe I need to learn more principles to continue.
