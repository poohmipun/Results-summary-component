# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

### Title: Code Refactoring Recommendations for Improved HTML and CSS

🔥HTML:
❌ Add a main element on the page and convert the outer section into the main.
❌ Replace the circle div with a paragraph element.
✅ Set the alt values of icons to empty since they are decorative.
❌ Avoid having text alone in spans or divs. Consider using a list for the results list, with spans inside each list item.

🔥CSS:
❌ Use a modern CSS reset, such as Andy Bell's.
✅ Remove the width and height from the card container, and use max-width instead.
✅ Avoid using font size in pixels (px).
✅ Avoid using magic numbers and fix the missing padding on .
✅ right-wrapper. Remove justify-items: center from .right-wrapper.
❌ Consider using classes instead of IDs for styling the results items.

### What I learned

"Embarking on my Frontend Journey! 🚀 Learning HTML and CSS with Frontend Mentor Challenges! 💻📚"

After about 4 hours of doing the wrong thing and asking ChatGPT for help, I finally finished the project. 😅 This project really made me realize that "this is 100% not the right way to do it." 😩 I'm exhausted, and I believe I need to learn more principles to continue.
